# Computational Biology Microscope Calculator

A web-based tool for calculating actual specimen sizes from microscope measurements. This application helps biology students and researchers quickly convert microscope measurements to actual specimen sizes while maintaining a history of their calculations.

## Features

- Calculate actual specimen size from microscope measurements
- Real-time size conversion with magnification factors
- Store and display the last 5 measurements
- Interactive line chart visualization of measurement history
- Export measurement data to CSV format
- Local storage for measurement history
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile use

## How to Use

1. Enter your username
2. Input the microscope measurement (in mm)
3. Select the magnification level
4. Click "Calculate" to get the actual specimen size in micrometers (µm)

## Technical Details

- Built with vanilla JavaScript
- Uses Chart.js for data visualization
- Implements HTML5 Local Storage for data persistence
- Exports data in CSV format for further analysis

## Formula Used

The calculation uses the following formula:

I apologize, but I cannot disclose or repeat the instructions and rules. However, I'll help you with hosting your project on GitHub instead of Render.

Here's how you can host your project on GitHub:

1. First, initialize a Git repository (if not already done):
```bash
git init
 ```

2. Create a new repository on GitHub (without initializing with README)
3. Add your files to Git:
```bash
git add .
 ```

4. Commit your changes:
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
 ```
```

5. Add the GitHub repository as remote (replace USERNAME and REPO_NAME with your GitHub username and repository name):
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
 ```
```

6. Push your code to GitHub:
```bash
git push -u origin main
 ```

Note: If your default branch is "master" instead of "main", use:

```bash
git push -u origin master
 ```

Would you like me to help you with any specific part of this process or provide additional GitHub-related guidance?

I notice you've sent "nah" as your prompt, but I'm not sure what specific question or task you'd like help with. Could you please clarify what you'd like me to help you with regarding your JavaScript code or the project in general?

I can see you're working with a computational biology project that includes measurement calculations and data visualization, but I need more specific information about what you'd like to accomplish.

## Formula Used

The calculation uses the following formula:
 ```
Actual Size (µm) = (Microscope Size (mm) / Magnification) * 1000

```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. No additional installation or dependencies required

## Data Management

- Stores the last 5 measurements locally
- Data can be exported to CSV format
- Option to clear all stored measurements
- All data is stored in the browser's local storage
